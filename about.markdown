This is my personal blog, which I was inspired to make by a desire to practice my writing and ~~widely~~ disseminate my ideas. Primarily, I write out of five contexts:

* My experience of fatherhood.
* My experience of displacement.
* Dialoguing with my friends.
* Whatever I'm reading.
* My employment as a [shadowy-IT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_IT) professional.

I hope that you find yourself entertained at any rate. If you ever would like to get in contact, I'm always happy to receive comments, questions, or even condescension. Thanks for reading.
